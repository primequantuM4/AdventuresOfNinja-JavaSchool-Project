# AdventuresOfNinja-JavaSchool-Project
A game that is developed using java, for Object Oriented Programming School Project

This is a 2-D shooter type of game that is minimalist and simplistic, It closely resembles the game called #cuphead since it was the inspiration I took while doing this project.
The game only consists of one boss as I didn't have time to do anymore than that.
Bugs: There are bugs that haven't been fixed, these bugs are:
     * Player can go out of the screen(collision wasn't handled on screen edges.)
     * Music overlaps with another music whenever the "Return to Main Menu" button is pressed upon. This is because of my insufficient knowledge on the sound class

Controls: Title Screen:
                    -> Navigation : "up", "down"
                    -> Confirm a choice: "Enter"
          In Game:
                  -> Movement: "W","A","D","S" - for jumping, moving left, moving right, and Crouching respectively. 
                  -> Shooting: "Space", Note: you can hold the space button for continuous shooting.
                  -> Pause/Play : "P"

  Music and Animations:
    For the music of the game I used music I found on YouTube.
    For the title screen I used this music: https://youtu.be/rHW2mtuc6pc It's from a game called "Fez" titled under the name "Legend"
    Other than the background (mountain and clouds),which was found on the internet, the characters and other stuff were designed by me using the platform piskel
